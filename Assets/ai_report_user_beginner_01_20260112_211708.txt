PART 1 — SUMMARY & ANALYSIS

A) Executive summary
- The client shows solid performance on basic forward mobility (a01_10m_forward 79%) and a single successful curb climb, but has clear deficits in backward control, obstacle negotiation, and advanced wheelie skills. 
- Highest priority deficits are wheelie skills (a27, a28 at 0%) and two-meter backward control (a02, 31%), with multiple specific training-plan steps flagged as problematic that point to issues with initial weight shift and control during transitions.

B) Direct answers to the four questions
- Which skills to prioritize now?
  - Prioritize a27_wheelie_30sec and a28_wheelie_turn_180 (both 0% with repeated attempts), then a02_2m_backward (low success, many errors), and a21_gap_15cm (20%).
- Which skills are adequate or improving?
  - a01_10m_forward (79%) and a25_curb_up_15cm (75%) are acceptable; a26_15cm_climb_up is 100% but only 1 attempt so interpret cautiously.
- Which specific steps are most problematic?
  - Problematic steps flagged: a05_turn_in_place_180 Step 1; a01_10m_forward Steps 2 & 3; a02_2m_backward Steps 1 & 3; a18_descend_10deg Step 1; a25_5cm_step_down Step 1; a05_backward_90_turn Step 3; a18_10deg_ramp_up Step 1.
- What immediate training actions do I recommend?
  - Break wheelie training into progressive subskills (static balance, short lifts, controlled forwards/backwards pressure, assisted practice), focus backward-control drills (slow reversible pushes, visual reference, small distances), rehearse the flagged steps in isolation with cueing and feedback, and add video/self-monitoring plus staged safety supports.

C) Compact table (skill_id | attempts | success_rate% | errors | most_problematic_step)

| skill_id | attempts | success_rate% | errors | most_problematic_step |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| a01_10m_forward | 19 | 79% | 2 | Steps 2 & 3 |
| a02_2m_backward | 13 | 31% |

A) Executive summary
User beginner_01 shows consistent competence on straight forward forward propulsion (a01) and some uphill handling (a17), but clear difficulty with backward control, turning, and wheelie-related skills. Highest immediate risk areas are short backward maneuvers and wheelies (several 0% or very low success rates). Several specific training-plan steps have been repeatedly problematic and should be targeted.

B) Direct answers to the four questions
- Which skills require highest priority training? Prioritize a02_2m_backward (31% success), a27_wheelie_30sec (0%), a28_wheelie_turn_180 (0%), and a21_gap_15cm (20%).
- Which skills show acceptable or good performance? a01_10m_forward (79%), a25_curb_up_15cm (75%), and a26_15cm_climb_up (100% but n=1) are relatively strong.
- Which steps are most commonly problematic in the training plan? Step 1 in a02_2m_backward, Step 2 and Step 3 in a01_10m_forward, Step 1 in a05_turn_in_place_180, and Step 1 in a18_descend_10deg are repeatedly flagged.
- What immediate training focus do I recommend? Emphasize controlled backward propulsion drills, foundational wheelie balance progression (starting with assisted short lifts), staged turning practice (180° and 90°), and targeted repetition of the flagged steps with clinician-led correction and safety supports.

PART 2 — 2-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM & CHECKLIST

Two-week, beginner-scaled program — 6 sessions (3 × week). Focus: improve backward control, turning (especially backward turns), wheelie fundamentals, and safe curb/gap handling. Sessions are 45–60 minutes each: brief warm-up, core skill blocks, and cool-down/reflection. Progression is gradual: increase distance/time or complexity only when you complete target reps with controlled technique and no safety errors in at least 4 of 5 attempts.

Schedule
- Week 1: Session 1 — Monday; Session 2 — Wednesday; Session 3 — Friday
- Week 2: Session 4 — Monday; Session 5 — Wednesday; Session 6 — Friday

General setup and safety before every session
- Flat, smooth, traffic-free practice area (gym floor, parking lot, quiet sidewalk).
- Wear gloves, closed shoes, and helmet for wheelie/curb practice. Have a competent spotter stand behind you for backward work and wheelies.
- Ensure anti-tip devices are correctly set; check tires and brakes.
- Keep rest 60–90 seconds between attempts/sets; hydrate.

Session 1 — Foundation and backward basics (45–50 min)
Goal: establish safe rearward body position, straight backward rolling, and small backward turns.

Warm-up (6–8 min)
- Easy forward rolling: 3 × 10 m at comfortable pace; practice smooth starts/stops. (3 reps)

Drill A — Rearward weight shift & backward hand placement (static) (6–8 min)
- Purpose: feel center of mass shift and prepare for backward pushes.
- How: Sit upright, feet on footplates. Practice leaning trunk slightly back (not slouched) while keeping head/eyes up. With brakes on, practice a quick backward shift of the hands on the rims (pull slightly toward you) then release the brake to feel the chair roll backward a few centimeters.
- Sets/Reps: 3 sets × 6 reps. Rest 30–45 sec between sets.

Drill B — Straight-line backward, 2 m (skill a02 focus) (12 min)
- Setup: mark a 2 m straight line with cones or tape.
- How: From a stop, look over shoulder (or turn head slightly) and roll straight backward to the line, then stop smoothly using small backward pushes and brakes.
- Sets/Reps: 5 sets × 4 reps (20 attempts). Guidance: keep shoulders relaxed, use short pushes, look over shoulder to monitor line.
- Progression cue: if 4/5 reps are controlled, increase to 5 m in a later session.

Drill C — Small backward turn: pivot 90° backward (a04 & a05_backward_90_turn basics) (10 min)
- How: Start facing forward, back up 1 m, then rotate shoulders while applying alternating backward pushes to pivot 90°. Use small short pushes — one side stronger to turn.
- Sets/Reps: 4 sets × 4 reps.
- If you spin too fast, reduce force on the turning side and increase opposing push slightly.

Cool-down + reflection (4–5 min)
- Light forward roll, check what felt stable/unstable. Note which attempts had errors.

Session 2 — Backward distance and controlled turns (50–55 min)
Goal: extend backward distance, improve visual referencing, and practice backward 2-3 step turns.

Warm-up (6 min)
- Forward control: 3 × 10 m, include one controlled stop at cone.

Drill A — Backward 5 m — progressive (a03) (15 min)
- Start: repeat 2 m drill 3 reps.
- Then attempt 5 m: 4 sets × 3 reps of 5 m backward.
- Tips: look over shoulder regularly; use small, frequent pushes rather than long ones.
- Progression rule: if success <60% after set, return to 2–3 m and repeat.

Drill B — Backward S-turn (maneuvering) (12 min)
- Setup: 3 cones spaced 1.5–2 m apart in a shallow S line.
- How: Back through cones in a smooth S pattern, emphasizing controlled small pushes and head turns.
- Sets/Reps: 5 runs.

Drill C — Back

Session schedule (6 sessions over 2 weeks)
- Week 1: Session 1 — Day 1, Session 2 — Day 3, Session 3 — Day 5
- Week 2: Session 4 — Day 8, Session 5 — Day 10, Session 6 — Day 12
Aim: 45–55 minutes per session. Rest 1–2 minutes between sets; longer rest if fatigued.

Session 1 — Foundation: forward control and 180° turns in place
Goal: consolidate forward propulsion and beginning steps of 180° turn in place.
Warm-up (8 min)
- 5 min easy propulsion on flat surface (comfortable pace).
- 3 min gentle steering drills: zig-zag cones ~1.5–2 m apart, slow controlled pushes.

Main drills (35–40 min)
1) 10 m forward control (a01)
- Drill: 5 sets of 3 reps each (3 x 10 m per set). Rest 60–90 s between sets.
- Cue: full recovery push stroke, look ahead, steady cadence.
- Progression across sessions: start with 3 pushes per 10 m, then reduce to 2 pushes, then continuous smooth propulsion with same number of reps.

2) 180° turn in place — Step 1 practice (a05 Step 1)
- Drill: 6 reps of the Step 1 pattern (slowly pivoting on one wheel using short pushes).
- Time: 2–3 min total practice, then 3 rounds of 6 reps with 1 min rest.
- Progression: once 6/6 reps are smooth, add timing (execute within 6–8 seconds), then reduce reliance on shoulders.

3) Combined forward + turn drill
- Drill: 4 sets of: 10 m forward, stop, attempt 180° turn-in-place (2 attempts), then 5 m forward.
- Reps: 4 sets, rest 90 s between.
- Progression: increase turn attempts completed to consistent success (aim 75% then 90%).

Cool-down (5–7 min)
- Light propulsion, mild shoulder/neck stretches.

Session 2 — Backward control and small backward turns
Goal: improve confidence and control in backward propulsion and backward turning.
Warm-up (8 min)
- 5 min forward rolling, 3 min backward twice the length at slow speed to acclimatize.

Main drills (35–40 min)
1) 2 m backward start (a02 Step 1 practice)
- Drill: 8 sets of 4 reps (short bursts). Each rep: reverse 2 m, stop.
- Cue: small, controlled backward pushes, eyes over shoulders, use mirrors or spotter.
- Progression: increase reps per set and reduce rest as control improves.

2) 5 m backward longer control (a03)
- Drill: 6 reps of 5 m backward at controlled pace. If unsafe, do assisted (spotter behind).
- Progression: once 4/6 reps are smooth, increase to 8 reps.

3) Backward 90° turn (a04 and a05 backward 90)
- Drill: 6–8 attempts of initiating a backward turn: two small reverse pushes plus one
